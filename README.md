<p>Greetings.</p></br>
<p> So this was my final project for asp.net.</p></br>
<p> I along with my teamate Jean King(jean@bridgelearning.org) worked hard on it.</p></br>
<p> It is a code geass fan website, the text content is a bit on the sparse side but we focused on other features such as a middleware to reroute users for using certain aliases. </p> </br>
<p> A more full document on it was writen which you can see <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z6D64kIl2dP6gFmI8jLTw8DuNRtQetVouqPPNxoMnH4/edit?tab=t.0'>here</a> </p>
